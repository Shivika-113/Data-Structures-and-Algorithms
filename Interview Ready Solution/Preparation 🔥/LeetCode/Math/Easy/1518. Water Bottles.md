# [1518\. Water Bottles](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Math](https://leetcode.com/tag/math/), [Simulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/simulation/)


There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return _the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_1_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_2_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
*   `2 <= numExchange <= 100`


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int maxBottles =0;
        int totalEmptyBottles=0;
        int emptyBottlesToBeExchanged=0;
        int emptyBottlesLeft =0;
        
        while(numBottles>0){
            maxBottles = maxBottles+numBottles;
            totalEmptyBottles = numBottles+emptyBottlesLeft; // after used empty bottle and previous empty bottle;
            
            emptyBottlesToBeExchanged= totalEmptyBottles/numExchange;
            emptyBottlesLeft = totalEmptyBottles%numExchange;
            
            numBottles = emptyBottlesToBeExchanged;
        }
        
        return maxBottles;
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int drink = numBottles; // I started by drinking the numBottles
        int numFull = 0;
        while(numBottles >= numExchange){ // while exchange is possible
            numFull = numBottles / numExchange; // get as many full bottles
            drink += numFull; // drink them
            numBottles = numFull + (numBottles % numExchange); // current bottles is what we just drank + anything we couldn't exchange
        }
        return drink;
    }
}
PROBLEM OVERVIEW
We want to find how many bottles of water we can drink, and with those empty water bottles, exchange them for full water bottles ... and so on!
(very thirsty person, I suppose...)

SOLUTION ASSESSMENT
There are one of 2 things to do:

Drink full water bottles
Exchange empty bottles for full bottles (if possible)
Basic Idea:

Run while exchange is possible
Keep track of full bottles and adding that to "drink."
Divide bottles by the exchange to see how many full bottles in return
Bottles will be 0 if the exchange is > than the bottles we have
Number of bottles is the amount we exchanged plus the leftover from the exchange
TIME COMPLEXITY
O(log_x(N))
x = numExchange
N = number of Bottles

Everytime we do an exchange, we are essentially dividing our inputs by x (numExchange). The number of times the code while-loop runs is approximately equal to the log_x(N). Since adding the bottles does not change the logrithmic pattern in the long-run, it is a logarithmic time complexity.

    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int totcalCount = numBottles;
        
        while(true){
            int drinkableBottle = numBottles / numExchange;
            int reminderBottle = numBottles % numExchange;
            totcalCount += drinkableBottle;
            numBottles = drinkableBottle + reminderBottle;
            if(numBottles < numExchange){
                break;
            }
        }
        return totcalCount;

    }

            totcalCount += drinkableBottle;
            numBottles = drinkableBottle + reminderBottle;
            if(numBottles < numExchange){
                break;
            }
        }
        return totcalCount;

    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        
         int ans = numBottles;     // store it in a variable
       
        while(numBottles>=numExchange){    // bottle quantity jab tak exchange se badi rhengi
           ans = ans + numBottles/numExchange;    // ye to samajh hi gaye honge 
            numBottles = numBottles/numExchange  +  numBottles%numExchange;   // finally add kr lo...
        }
        return ans;   // or ye hmare result bhaiSahab.....
    }
}
```
