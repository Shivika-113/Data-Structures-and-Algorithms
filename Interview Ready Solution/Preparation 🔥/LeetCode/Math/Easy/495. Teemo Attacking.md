# [495\. Teemo Attacking](https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Simulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/simulation/)


Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More formally, an attack at second `t` will mean Ashe is poisoned during the **inclusive** time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again **before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset**, and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return _the **total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= timeSeries.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 10<sup>7</sup>
*   `timeSeries` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int count = duration;
        for(int i=1; i<timeSeries.length; i++){
            int prevPoisoneEffectOverTime = timeSeries[i-1]+duration;
            if(timeSeries[i]<=prevPoisoneEffectOverTime){
                count = count-(prevPoisoneEffectOverTime-timeSeries[i]);
            }
            count  = count+duration;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}

/*
​
- temmo attacking on emeny ashe. with posison attack.
- when temo attacks ash posioned. extacly duration seconds.
- attack at second t. and ashe posisoned insculive time interaval 
- [t, t+duration -1].
- if attack again before posion effect and. timer reset. and effect end duration second.
​
- given non decreasing array.
- timerseries detone [i] - temmo atack on ashe on seconds.
- timer series [i] seconds.
- integer duration. 
​
- return toal number of secons that are is posioned.
​
timerSeries 1 4  , duration 2 
​
- temmo attack second 1.  ashe posioned = 1 second and 2 second.
- temmo attack second 4.  ahsed posioned = 4 5... 4 incluive till 2. 1  2 so 4 5.
- so ashe poisoned for seconds  - 1 2 4 5 so total is 4 seconds.
​
timerseries 1 2 duration 2.
​
- 1 second - poison 1 ,2 
- 2 second = temmo attack again. and posiion timer reset. so temmo poison 2 3 second.
-so total is. - 1 2 3 .  3 seconds total.
​
code dry run.
1 4   , 2
count =2;
i = 1.. till length;
​
prevOverTime  = 1+2 = 3
current = 4. 
4<=3 ? not. so
count will be.   2+ 2 = 4.
​
​
1 2 , 2
​
count 2. 
1 + 2 = 3.
prev = 3.
if( 2<=3) ? yes.
2- (3-2) = 2 - 1 = 1;
1 + 2 = 3;
