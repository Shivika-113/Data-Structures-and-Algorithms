# [495\. Teemo Attacking](https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Simulation](https://leetcode.com/tag/simulation/)


Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More formally, an attack at second `t` will mean Ashe is poisoned during the **inclusive** time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again **before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset**, and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return _the **total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= timeSeries.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 10<sup>7</sup>
*   `timeSeries` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int count = duration;
        for(int i=1; i<timeSeries.length; i++){
            int prevPoisoneEffectOverTime = timeSeries[i-1]+duration;
            if(timeSeries[i]<=prevPoisoneEffectOverTime){
                count = count-(prevPoisoneEffectOverTime-timeSeries[i]);
            }
            count  = count+duration;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}

- temmo attacking on emeny ashe. with posison attack.
- when temo attacks ash posioned. extacly duration seconds.
- attack at second t. and ashe posisoned insculive time interaval 
- [t, t+duration -1].
- if attack again before posion effect and. timer reset. and effect end duration second.
​
- given non decreasing array.
- timerseries detone [i] - temmo atack on ashe on seconds.
- timer series [i] seconds.
- integer duration. 
​
- return toal number of secons that are is posioned.
​
timerSeries 1 4  , duration 2 
​
- temmo attack second 1.  ashe posioned = 1 second and 2 second.
- temmo attack second 4.  ahsed posioned = 4 5... 4 incluive till 2. 1  2 so 4 5.
- so ashe poisoned for seconds  - 1 2 4 5 so total is 4 seconds.
​
timerseries 1 2 duration 2.
​
- 1 second - poison 1 ,2 
- 2 second = temmo attack again. and posiion timer reset. so temmo poison 2 3 second.
-so total is. - 1 2 3 .  3 seconds total.
​
code dry run.
1 4   , 2
count =2;
i = 1.. till length;
​
prevOverTime  = 1+2 = 3
current = 4. 
4<=3 ? not. so
count will be.   2+ 2 = 4.
​
​
1 2 , 2
​
count 2. 
1 + 2 = 3.
prev = 3.
if( 2<=3) ? yes.
2- (3-2) = 2 - 1 = 1;
1 + 2 = 3;

        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length-1; i++) {

                total += timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i];
            } else { // add duration normally
                total += duration;
            }
        }
        total += duration; // include last attack from teemo
        return total;
    }
}

```

```java
We need to find the time for which opponent was poisoned.
Therefore,

If array is empty, return 0
As the timeframes are in ascending order, we find Minimum of duration and timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i-1]. This is because either he will be poisoned for complete duration, or till he was poisoned again.
At the last timeframe, the opponent will be poisoned for the complete duration. So, add duration at the end.
class Solution {

public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
    
    int pTime = 0;
    
	// If array is empty, return 0
    if(timeSeries.length == 0)
        return 0;
    
    for(int i = 1; i < timeSeries.length; i++) {
        
		// Find minimum of duration and difference between timeframes.
        pTime += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i-1]);
        
    }
    
	// Add the last complete duration of poisoned
    pTime += duration;
    
    return pTime;
    
}
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        
        int im1v9 = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length - 1; i++){
            int start = timeSeries[i];
            int end = timeSeries[i + 1];
            
            int inter = end - start;
            if(start + duration > end){
                im1v9 += inter;
            }else{
                im1v9 += duration;
            }
        }
        
        // add at the end for the last INTer
        return im1v9 + duration;
    }
    
}

```

```java
dea:

An attack's effect ends at t = timeSeries[i] + duration - 1 seconds, so if the next attack is after t, then entire duration is counted
Else timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i] is counted
The final attack lasts for full duration
T/S: O(n)/O(1)

public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
	var poisoned = 0;
	for (var i = 0; i + 1 < timeSeries.length; i++)
		if (timeSeries[i] + duration - 1 < timeSeries[i + 1])
			poisoned += duration;
		else
			poisoned += timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i];
			
	return poisoned + duration;
}
Version 2: The above can be simplified to:

public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
	var poisoned = duration;
	
	for (var i = 0; i + 1 < timeSeries.length; i++)
		poisoned += Math.min(duration, timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i]);
	
	return poisoned;
}

```

            ret += duration;
            if (timeSery <= lastEnd) {
                ret -= (lastEnd - timeSery + 1);
