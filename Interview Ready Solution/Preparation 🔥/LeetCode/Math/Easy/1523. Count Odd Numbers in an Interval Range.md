# [1523\. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Math](https://leetcode.com/tag/math/)


Given two non-negative integers `low` and `<font face="monospace">high</font>`. Return the _count of odd numbers between_ `low` _and_ `<font face="monospace">high</font>`_ (inclusive)_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= low <= high <= 10^9`


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if(low%2==0) low = low+1;
        if(high%2==0) high = high-1;
        
        int count =0;
        count = ((high-low)/2)+1;
        
        return count;
    }
}
​
/*
​
if any case low comes starting with even then for make odd we do +1;
if any case high comes with ending even then decreaming this -1 for making odd.
​
and  now we do formula here.
​
7 -3 = 4 / 2  = 2 +1  
​
in that higher value - from the lower value. and do /2 because half of value
are in this are will be odd. so we do /2;
and we do +1 because of low and high also inclusive. 
​
so here 7 -3 is 4 and do 4/2 so between 7 and 3 are 2 value are odd. and we do +1 because of they are inclusive.
​
10-8 = 2 . 2/2 = 
​10-8 =  so in that case.
10 and 8 is even so for that.
we do.
8++ = 9 and 10 -- to 9.
so now 9/2 = 0; +1 = 1;
*/
```

```java
Case 1: when the range starts and ends with an odd number.
for a small range, lets see how it looks like-
odd-even-odd-even-odd
[odd-even], [odd-even], [odd]

We see alternate odd and even numbers, and there is just one odd number at the end which does not have an even pair!

So, count of even numbers ==(nums/2), then there is just one extra odd number,
therefore, number of odd numbers= (nums/2) + 1

Now, Consider these cases-

Case 2: starting with odd ending with even
odd-even-odd-even
[odd-even], [odd-even]

Case 3: starting with even ending with odd
even-odd-even-odd
[even-odd], [even,odd]

In both the above cases,
count of odd==count of even== nums/2

Last Case
Case 4: starting with even ending with even
even-odd-even-odd-even
[even-odd], [even,odd], [even]

count of odd=nums/2 , which is similar to case 1 and here we have an extra even number instead of odd, so no need to add anything!

So in all cases except Case 1, the answer is nums/2!

 public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
       int nums=high-low+1;  //counting total numbers in range
 
		if(low%2!=0 && high%2!=0)  
            return nums/2 + 1;
        
        else
		return nums/2;
    }

```
