# [11\. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/), [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)


You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i<sup>th</sup> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
     int s =0;
     int e = height.length-1;
     int max_area =0;
     while(s<e){
         int curr_area = (e-s) * (Math.min(height[s],height[e]));
         if(height[s]<height[e]) s++;
         else e--;
         
         // count max_area
         max_area = Math.max(max_area,curr_area);
     }
        return max_area;
    }
}
​
/*
so in that what are doing.
basically. 
we need to find max area.
so that what we do.
start from first index and end index.
​
then check.
​
which value is smaller first index or second index.
and one more think.
we subtract -  first index and end index.
and then
we do
​
subtracted index multiply with minimum value.
​
and then we also increase our move left or move right.
​
so for that.
we check if first index is smaller then its go to right side.
it our end index element is smaller then its go to left.
​
and after that we check max area. curr area which we get from end index - curr index. and minimum between curr element vs last element.
and put max into the max area variable.
